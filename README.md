# Programming Languages Family Tree

The family tree of major programming languages in a visual display.

## Explanation

### Assembly Language

**Assembly Language**: The starting point for low-level languages that translate directly to machine code. From here, higher-level languages began to evolve.

### Machine Code and Early High-Level Languages

-   **Autocode**: One of the first high-level languages, leading to the development of ALGOL.
-   **Fortran**: The first widely-used high-level language, influencing many scientific and engineering languages.
-   **LISP**: One of the oldest high-level languages, which influenced many languages in the functional programming domain.

### ALGOL Family

-   **ALGOL 58, 60, and 68**: These languages were highly influential in the development of structured programming and spawned many other languages.
-   **Simula 67**: An extension of ALGOL, it introduced object-oriented programming concepts, leading to languages like Smalltalk and C++.
-   **Pascal**: Derived from ALGOL, it influenced languages focused on teaching and structured programming.

### C Family

-   **BCPL, B, and C**: Developed as a system programming language, C became one of the most influential languages, leading to many descendants like C++, Objective-C, and C#.
-   **C++**: An extension of C that added object-oriented features.
-   **Objective-C**: Combined C with Smalltalk-style messaging, eventually influencing Swift.
-   **C#**: Developed by Microsoft, heavily influenced by C++ and Java.

### Java and Its Descendants

-   **Java**: Developed with a focus on portability and security, Java has a vast influence, especially in enterprise environments.
-   **JavaScript**: Though it shares the name, it is more influenced by Self and Scheme. JavaScript's role in web development is immense, leading to languages like TypeScript and ECMAScript.
-   **Swift**: Developed by Apple as a successor to Objective-C, borrowing concepts from various modern languages.

### Python Family

-   **Python**: Known for its readability and simplicity, Python has influenced many modern programming practices.
-   **Ruby**: Influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, and Python, it emphasizes simplicity and productivity.
-   **Python 3**: A major update to Python that fixed many inconsistencies and introduced new features.

### LISP Family

-   **Scheme and Common Lisp**: Variants of LISP that have influenced many functional programming languages.
-   **Clojure**: A modern LISP dialect that runs on the JVM, emphasizing concurrency and immutability.

### ML Family

-   **ML Family**: Including Standard ML and OCaml, these languages focus on functional programming and type safety.
-   **Haskell**: A purely functional language with strong type inference, influencing many modern functional languages.
